üí™ Personalized Workout & Diet Recommender
A smart, data-driven recommendation system that generates personalized workout routines, equipment suggestions, and diet plans based on user-specific health data and fitness goals.

üåü Overview
This project leverages machine learning to provide tailored fitness recommendations. By inputting key personal metrics such as age, sex, BMI, and health conditions (like hypertension or diabetes), users receive a complete fitness plan. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the most suitable exercises, equipment, and dietary guidelines from a comprehensive dataset.

The goal is to eliminate the guesswork in fitness by providing a clear, actionable, and personalized path for users to achieve their health objectives, whether it's weight loss, weight gain, or muscle building.

‚ú® Key Features
Personalized Recommendations: Get custom suggestions for exercises, gym equipment, and diet plans.

Health-Aware: The model takes into account crucial health factors like hypertension and diabetes to provide safe and effective recommendations.

Goal-Oriented: Tailors recommendations based on the user's primary fitness goal (e.g., Weight Gain, Weight Loss).

Data-Driven: Built on a dataset of over 14,000 entries to ensure robust and varied suggestions.

Multi-Output Model: Predicts three distinct outputs (Exercises, Equipment, Diet) from a single user input.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
This project is built using the following technologies and libraries:

Language: Python

Core Libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and loading the dataset from the .xlsx file.

Scikit-learn: For building and training the machine learning models (RandomForestClassifier, LabelEncoder).

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

üöÄ How It Works
The recommendation logic is powered by three distinct RandomForestClassifier models, each trained for a specific purpose:

Input Data: The system takes the following user attributes as input:

Sex (Male/Female)

Age

Hypertension (Yes/No)

Diabetes (Yes/No)

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Fitness Goal (e.g., Weight Gain)

Data Preprocessing: Categorical features like Sex and Fitness Goal are converted into numerical format using LabelEncoder.

Prediction: The processed input is fed into three trained models:

ex_model: Predicts the optimal set of Exercises.

eq_model: Recommends the necessary Equipment.

diet_model: Suggests a suitable Diet plan.

Output: The system returns a dictionary containing the complete, personalized recommendation.

Model Performance
The models achieved the following accuracies on the test set:

Exercises Model Accuracy: ~99.6%

Equipment Model Accuracy: ~92.1%

Diet Model Accuracy: ~68.3%
